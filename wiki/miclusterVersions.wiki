    * SVN moved from the EnCore project to its own SVN

== Version 1.4 ==

    * It includes additional functionality to create PSI binary interaction from clustered interactions. Now clusters can be easily exported to PSI MITAB25 using PSI Java libraries.
    * It includes caching options implemented by Sam Kerrien to avoid memory problems when clustering more than 400.000 interactions.
    * It includes an new option to set a preference when mapping molecule accession to build the cluster.
    * It includes an additional result (synonymMapping) to help users to find interactor synonyms.
