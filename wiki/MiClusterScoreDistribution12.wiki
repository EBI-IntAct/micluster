== Example ==
Here two examples of how to create score distribution histograms:
<br>
=== Querying a PSICQUIC database, printing a chart and saving the scores in a CSV file: ===
{{{
...
        MiscoreDistribution mD = new MiscoreDistributionImp("*:*","MatrixDB");
        mD.createChart();
        mD.saveScores();
...
}}}
<br/>
=== Printing a chart from scores: ===
{{{
...
        String scores = "0.43887317,0.558037,0.43887317,0.43887317,0.43887317,0.683472,0.558037,0.76561326,0.43887317,0.43887317,0.43887317,0.43887317,0.43887317,0.6230328,0.43887317,0.5871889,0.43887317,0.5221931,0.43887317,0.6631005,0.43887317,0.43887317,0.43887317,0.6230328,0.43887317,0.6230328,0.43887317,0.43887317,0.6230328,0.43887317,0.43887317,0.43887317,0.43887317,0.558037";
        MiscoreDistribution mD = new MiscoreDistributionFromCsvScores(scores);
        mD.createChart();
...
}}}

<br/>
=== Printing a chart using a CSV file of scores: ===
{{{
...
        MiscoreDistribution mD = new MiscoreDistributionImp("MatrixDB_Scores.txt");
        mD.createChart();
...
}}}
==== Example of the content of a CSV file ====
{{{
0.31468466,0.3042728,0.33558023,0.3042728,0.33558023,0.2952445,0.33558023,0.42515436,0.3668876,0.2952445,0.3042728,0.3042728,0.3042728
